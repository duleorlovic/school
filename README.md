# School Rails App

This is Rails app for the task

> I want you to create a project from scratch. We want to represent a school, so there are teachers, classes, classrooms, and students. Students have many classes, teachers have many classes, and a classroom has many classes. I want to be able to edit, add, and remove teachers, students, and classes.

> I know these are very basic requirements, but please use your best judgement if anything is confusing. Feel free to use rails scaffolds to build this representation quickly, the front end can be simple and server rendered. Don’t include anything you don’t need, like devise, pundit, or sidekiq for now. I want to see how you build your models and controllers, and I want to see your best work. We will extend the functionality of this in our next interview. And please don’t spend more than 4 hours, if you cannot finish it in this time that’s ok.
